    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
        In 2010, Brutus Burger House founder Nicolae Hegenski had the
        chance to bring his cooking skills to perfection at the French Culinary
        Institute in New York and he didn’t hesitate. Together with his wife Maria,
        a restaurant-manager herself, he made his way across the pond to the big city.
    </p>

    <p>
        They had one big dream: one day to open a restaurant in their hometown, Bucharest
        and serve food crafted from local ingredients. Inspired by the American style of food,
        they didn’t wait long and opened their first Brutus Burger House in Bucharest
        in January of 2012. Their mission was high quality food made with local ingredients,
        fresh products and attention to detail.

<article id="why-do-we-do-this">
    <h1>Why do we do this, you ask?</h1>
    <p>
        First of all because we want to promote the idea that you can cook any recipe
        you want using healty ingredients sourced by local producers, thus supporting them financally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, we do this because we have a passion for cooking, obviously.
        And our only goal is to make YOU happy. ;)

    <h1>All of our ingredients are produced locally.</h1>
    <section id="beef">
        <img src="../images/cows.jpg">
        <h1>Regional beef</h1>
        <p>
            Our beef at Brutus Burger House stands for two things: quality and regional origin.
            That’s why we offer 100% juicy beef from a farmer from Transilvania for our guests.
            The cows spend their lifetime breathing the fresh air of the Carpathian Mountains and
            enjoy a happy life in the open countryside with more than enough space. By working
            together closely with our farmer we make sure our guests at Brutus Burger House get the best
            beef there is. And you can definitely taste it!
        </p>

    <section id="buns">
        <img src="../images/bun.png">
        <h1>Housemade bread</h1>
        <p>
            We are extremely proud of our burger buns. Thanks to a homemade
            recipe by founder Nicole Hegenski, our guests at Brutus Burger House can enjoy
            the perfect buns, fluffy and tasty at the same time. We bake our buns fresh
            every day so we can offer the best quality to our customers. Combined with our
            regional beef, these two main elements lay the foundation for our burgers.
        </p>

    <section id="sauce">
        <img src="../images/sauces.jpg">
        <h1>Own sauce recipes</h1>
        <p>
            Every burger at Brutus Burger House provides a unique flavor.
            Main reasons are our delicious, homemade sauces.
            To make them, we of course only use fresh products,
            so we stick to our mission: to offer our guests the best quality possible.
            From our secret Caesar's Death Sauce to our daily fresh made guacamole,
            these sauces, combined with our beef and our buns, result in the unique taste
            of our burgers.
